# Inception

## 1. Overview

The project creates of a LEMP stack setup, using *Linux* as the host operating system, *Nginx* as the web server to handle HTTP requests, *MariaDB* as the relational database management system and *PHP* as the server side programming language to process requests and generate dynamic content. 

It offers *performance*, as Nginx can handle mulitple concurrent requests, with low memory usage and *flexibility* as it is able to work well with for modern high-traffic websites. 

The project's main components of the setup are explained in the following sections.

## 2. Nginx

Nginx is an open source web server and reverse proxy service. 

- It can work as the traffic controller for web requests: deciding what happens when a user‚Äôs browser asks for something (like a web page or image).

- It can serve the files directly: when the user is visiting `https://example.com`, Nginx looks for the corresponding .html file and returns it.

- It can also work as *reverse proxy*: forwards requests to another service, such as a backend app.

- It can also handle encryption (TLS/SSL certificates), so that apps don't need to.

### 2.2 Dockerfile

The Dockerfile for Nginx:

  <br>

</div>
<br>


We have already copied and modified the configuration file `/etc/nginx/sites-available/default`, from inside the container outside, in order to set up the communication with the PHP, by opening up port 9000. After that, we have to replace the original configuration file, with the modified one.

**IMPORTANT**: The Nginx's `-g "daemon off;"` flag sets a global configuration directive from the command line, instead of only from the configuration file (nginx.conf), as it disables Nginx's defaut behavior of running in the background, as a deamon. Instead, with this directive, the process remains in the foreground, so the container's process can stay alive and running.


### 2.3 Single Container

Running the single container is useful when first setting up the service, to check if there is any misconfiguration in the Dockerfile. It's important to remember though to keep it as simple as possible. In the case of the Nginx service, we don't want to copy any configuration file back into the container, as this will override any default global instructions and make the container listen for the wp-php's container's port 9000.

If we uncomment that part (*line 8*), the container can stay alive and running and we can then check for the specific port in the localhost for Nginx's welcome message. Otherwise the container's creation will **fail**. To test it, we build and run the container:

```
$ docker build -t nginx srcs/requirements/nginx/.
$ docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx
```

This Dockerfile starts the web server and is listening for requests. We can already access it in the local port 80 `https://localhost/80`. If the engine started correctly, we will be able to see a Nginx welcome message!

## 3. Wordpress / PHP

Wordpress is an open source Content Management System (CMS), which basically means that it lets the user build websites and blogs, without coding everything from scratch. It is written in PHP and uses a MySQL/MariaDB database. When a request requires PHP execution (like loading a WordPress page), Nginx passes the request to PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager), then returns the result back to the Nginx, and finally Nginx sends it back to the client.


### 3.1 Installation / run

<div align="center">
  
| Command                             | Description                    |
|-------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `$ apt install php8.2-fpm`          | Downloads and installs PHP-FPM |
| `$ apt install php8.2-mysql`        | Downloads and installs PHP-FPM |

### 3.2 Dockerfile

The Dockerfile for WP-PHP:

<div align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chrisov/Inception/37d4d53ec64d2ed7c2a0bfa2b9c6751c59f177f6/srcs/requirements/wordpress/dfile.png" width="700" alt="nginx dockerfile"/>
  <br>
  Figure F3.2.1: Worpress Dockerfile
</div>
  <br>


Without proper configuration, the two services (Ngnix, PHP) cannot communicate. To achieve that, we need to access the PHP-FPM's pool configuration file, `/etc/php/8.2/fpm/pool.d/www.conf` and set up the communicaton channel in port 9000.

This Dockerfile starts the container on a PHP image, copies the configuration file from the project's directory into the container, since that file is already properly modified and it will allow the communication with Nginx to happen. 

**IMPORTANT**: The PHP's `-F` flag, is used, similarly to Ngnix, to bring the running process on the foreground, so that the container can remain alive and running. Without it, the container would start the process and then exit.


### 3.3 Single Container

As was the case for Nginx, if we want to run a single wp-php container, we need to uncomment any lines that mess the default global configurations (line 20), as it makes the container listen in the port 9000 instead of the localhost. After that building and running the single container is straight-forward: 

```
$ docker build -t wordpress srcs/requirements/wordpress/.
$ docker run wordpress
```

**We can check that the service is up and running (TODO)**

## 4. MariaDB

MariaDB is an open source database management system, similar to MySQL in terms of commands and protocols, that the user can use to store, organize, and query structured data in the format of tables, with rows and columns. 

- It can connect data between tables using *primary* (unique IDs) and *foreign* keys (references).

- The user can insert, update delete and fetch data, using *SQL*.

- It can control which user can have access to which database.
