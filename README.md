# Inception

## Overview

The project creates of a LEMP stack setup, using *Linux* as the host operating system, *Nginx* as the web server to handle HTTP requests, *MariaDB* as the relational database management system and *PHP* as the server side programming language to process requests and generate dynamic content. 

It offers *performance*, as Nginx can handle mulitple concurrent requests, with low memory usage and *flexibility* as it is able to work well with for modern high-traffic websites. 

The project's main components of the setup are explained in the following sections.

## Nginx

Nginx is an open source web server and reverse proxy. It can work as the traffic controller for web requests: deciding what happens when a user‚Äôs browser asks for something (like a web page or image).

- It can serve the files directly, when the user is visiting `https://example.com`, Nginx looks for the corresponding .html file and returns it.

- It can also work as *reverse proxy*, to forward requests to another service, such as a backend app, it sends that request to the corresponding service.

- It can also handle encryption (TLS/SSL certificates), so that apps don't need to.

## MariaDB

MariaDB is an open source database management system, similar to MySQL in terms of commands and protocols, that the user can use to store, organize, and query structured data in the format of tables, with rows and columns. 

- It can connect data between tables using *primary* (unique IDs) and *foreign* keys (references).

- The user can insert, update delete and fetch data, using *SQL*.

- It can control which user can have access to which database.
